Postmortem for Outage on May 10, 2024
Issue Summary
On May 10, 2024, from 10:45 AM to 12:15 PM (UTC), there was an outage affecting our e-commerce platform. The platform experienced a significant slowdown and intermittent unavailability, impacting approximately 40% of users. Users were facing extended page load times and occasional connection timeouts when attempting to browse or make purchases. The root cause was an unanticipated spike in traffic due to a mistakenly scheduled promotional email campaign, which overloaded our primary database.
Timeline
10:45 AM: The issue was detected by our monitoring system, which triggered alerts indicating increased latency and error rates on the main application servers.
10:50 AM: Initial investigation began with on-call engineers checking server metrics, assuming the root cause was a server or network issue.
11:00 AM: Engineers noticed high database load and began investigating database performance and queries.
11:15 AM: Further analysis showed a correlation between the spike in traffic and a recent email campaign promoting a flash sale, which had gone live at 10:30 AM.
11:20 AM: The issue was escalated to the database and marketing teams for further investigation and coordination.
11:30 AM: The email campaign was paused to reduce traffic to the platform, and database queries were optimized to handle the load better.
12:00 PM: The platform's performance began to stabilize as database load decreased.
12:15 PM: The incident was officially resolved, with normal performance levels restored.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was an unexpected spike in traffic from a promotional email campaign. The campaign, which was meant to go live at a later date, triggered a flash sale and sent users rushing to the website, causing a sudden surge in traffic that overwhelmed the primary database.
The resolution involved pausing the email campaign to reduce incoming traffic and optimizing database queries to improve performance. These steps allowed the platform to regain stability and normal performance levels.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Improve coordination between marketing and engineering teams to avoid scheduling conflicts and unanticipated traffic surges.
Implement more robust load testing for critical application components, particularly the database, to handle traffic spikes better.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to traffic spikes more quickly.
Tasks:
Audit and improve scheduling procedures for promotional campaigns to ensure alignment with platform capabilities and server capacity.
Review and optimize database queries, indexes, and configurations for better performance during traffic spikes.
Add real-time monitoring for marketing campaigns to better predict and manage traffic surges.
Conduct load tests for the entire web stack to validate capacity and performance under traffic scenarios.
By implementing these corrective measures, we aim to mitigate the risk of future incidents and ensure a more stable and reliable platform for our users.
